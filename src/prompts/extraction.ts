export const AESTHETIC_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are extracting structured creative vocabulary from a web page about a visual aesthetic, art style, or design movement. Extract ONLY terms that exist in the source text or are directly implied by it. Do not invent terms.

Extract the following categories:

1. aesthetic_name: The canonical name of the aesthetic or movement described on this page.

2. visual_atoms: Concrete visual descriptors. Things you can see, render, or photograph. Single terms or short 2-3 word phrases. Examples: "neon glow", "chrome surfaces", "wet asphalt", "holographic", "brutalist concrete". Max 30.

3. color_atoms: Specific colors, color relationships, or color moods mentioned. Examples: "deep magenta", "electric blue", "desaturated earth tones", "gold and black". Max 15.

4. material_atoms: Textures, materials, surface qualities. Examples: "brushed steel", "cracked leather", "iridescent fabric", "oxidized copper". Max 15.

5. atmospheric_phrases: Multi-word atmospheric descriptions that set a scene. These are longer than single atoms. Examples: "rain-slicked highway reflecting sodium vapor lights", "dust motes in cathedral light". Max 10.

6. related_aesthetics: Other named aesthetics referenced in or related to this one. For each, specify the relationship:
   - "parent": This aesthetic evolved FROM the related one
   - "child": The related aesthetic evolved FROM this one
   - "sibling": They share common ancestry or are peers
   - "influence": This aesthetic was influenced by the related one
   - "opposite": The related aesthetic is a stylistic opposite

7. harmonic_profile: The overall feel of this aesthetic across 5 dimensions, each a number from 0 to 1:
   - hardness: 0 = soft/organic, 1 = hard/geometric
   - temperature: 0 = cool, 1 = warm
   - weight: 0 = light/ethereal, 1 = heavy/dense
   - formality: 0 = casual/raw, 1 = formal/refined
   - era_affinity: 0 = contemporary, 1 = historical
